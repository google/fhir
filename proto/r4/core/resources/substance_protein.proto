// Auto-generated from StructureDefinition for SubstanceProtein, last updated
// 2018-12-27T22:37:54.724+11:00. A SubstanceProtein is defined as a single unit
// of a linear amino acid sequence, or a combination of subunits that are either
// covalently linked or have a defined invariant stoichiometric relationship.
// This includes all synthetic, recombinant and purified SubstanceProteins of
// defined sequence, whether the use is therapeutic or prophylactic. This set of
// elements will be used to describe albumins, coagulation factors, cytokines,
// growth factors, peptide/SubstanceProtein hormones, enzymes, toxins, toxoids,
// recombinant vaccines, and immunomodulators. See
// http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/SubstanceProtein
