I have a FHIR connectathon meeting in 2 weeks and want to hack up something using google's grpc FHIR as an example over json BUT have questions and not sure
where to ask them so I am doing a pull request so this gets seen.

I am getting into FHIR and the README has no mention of where to post questions (stack overflow with grpc-fhir tag?)

I am wondering how to file issues too(I don't see an issues link) AND checking out the repo has file collisions reported on mac which is weird as I see all those files BUT on windows, that would totally screw up.  I will delete the upper case named files as part of this pull request

  Also, is there a java example of depending on a certain version of this repo...OR do I just check out based on tag and depend on proto files on the filesystem?  Trying to figure out the best strategy here and hoping someone has options
