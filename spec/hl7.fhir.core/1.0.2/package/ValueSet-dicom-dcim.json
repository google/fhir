              <td>Hyperplasia is also known as epithelial hyperplasia or proliferative breast disease. It's an overgrowth of the cells that line the ducts or the lobules. Based on how the cells look under a microscope, the hyperplasia is called either ductal hyperplasia (also called duct epithelial hyperplasia) or lobular hyperplasia. Based on the pattern of the cells, hyperplasia may be called usual or atypical. In usual hyperplasia, the pattern of cells is very close to normal. Atypical hyperplasia (or hyperplasia with atypia) is a term used when the cells are more distorted.

Invasive cancer means the cancer cells have broken out of the lobule where they began and have the potential to spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body. Invasive lobular carcinoma typically doesn't form a lump, which is common in breast cancer. Instead, there is a change in the breast that feels like a thickening or fullness in one part of the breast and is different from the surrounding breast tissue.
