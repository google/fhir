Typically, this is used for status, negation and qualification codes. The effect of this is that the element cannot be ignored by systems: they SHALL either recognize the element and process it, and/or a pre-determination has been made that it is not relevant to their particular system.","comment":"Only the definition of an element can set IsModifier true - either the specification itself or where an extension is originally defined. Once set, it cannot be changed in derived profiles. An element/extension that has isModifier=true SHOULD also have a minimum cardinality of 1, so that there is no lack of clarity about what to do if it is missing. If it can be missing, the definition SHALL make the meaning of a missing element clear.","requirements":"Allows elements to be introduced into a specification that can't safely be ignored by applications that don't recognize them.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"defaultValueBoolean":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A (MIF territory)"},{"identity":"iso11179","map":"??"}]}]}
