If the only thing that is unknown is how to properly express the value in the necessary constraints (value set, datatype, etc.), then the OTH or UNC flavor should be used.  No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless:\r\n\n                        \n                           Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of \"unknown\".  (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown')\n                           Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown.  (E.g. specifying a use code of \"H\" and a URL prefix of \"tel:\" to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)","concept":[{"code":"ASKU","display":"asked but unknown","definition":"Information was sought but not found (e.g., patient was asked but didn't know)","concept":[{"code":"NAV","display":"temporarily unavailable","definition":"Information is not available at this time but it is expected that it will be available later."}]},{"code":"NASK","display":"not asked","definition":"This information has not been sought (e.g., patient was not asked)"},{"modifierExtension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/codesystem-subsumes","valueCode":"NAV"}],"code":"NAVU","display":"Not available","definition":"Information is not available at this time (with no expectation regarding whether it will or will not be available in the future)."},{"code":"QS","display":"Sufficient Quantity","definition":"Description:The specific quantity is not known, but is known to be non-zero and is not specified because it makes up the bulk of the material. e.g. 'Add 10mg of ingredient X, 50mg of ingredient Y, and sufficient quantity of water to 100mL.'
