If the rate is intended to change over time, depending on local rules/regulations, each change should be captured as a new version of the MedicationRequest with an updated rate, or captured with a new MedicationRequest with the new rate.\r\rIt is possible to specify a rate over time (for example, 100 ml/hour) using either the rateRatio and rateQuantity.  The rateQuantity approach requires systems to have the capability to parse UCUM grammer where ml/hour is included rather than a specific ratio where the time is specified as the denominator.  Where a rate such as 500ml over 2 hours is specified, the use of rateRatio may be more semantically correct than specifying using a rateQuantity of 250 mg/hour.","requirements":"Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into the patient. Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Ratio"},{"code":"Range"},{"code":"Quantity","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/SimpleQuantity"]}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"RXE22, RXE23, RXE-24"},{"identity":"rim","map":".rateQuantity"}]}]}}
