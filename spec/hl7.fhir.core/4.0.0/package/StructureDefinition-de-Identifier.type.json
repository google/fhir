It SHOULD not be used for codes that correspond 1..1 with the Identifier.system. Some identifiers may fall into multiple categories due to common usage.   Where the system is known, a type is unnecessary because the type is always part of the system definition. However systems often need to handle identifiers where the system is not known. There is not a 1:1 relationship between type and system, since many different systems have the same type.","requirements":"Allows users to make use of identifiers when the identifier system is not known.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Identifier.type","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"IdentifierType"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-isCommonBinding","valueBoolean":true}],"strength":"extensible","description":"A coded type for an identifier that can be used to determine which identifier to use for a specific purpose.","valueSet":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type"},"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"CX.5"},{"identity":"rim","map":"Role.code or implied by context"}]}]}}
