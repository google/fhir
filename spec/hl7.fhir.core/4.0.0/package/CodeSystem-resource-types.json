A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. \n\nThe primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProduct\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProduct\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProduct</td>\n                <td>Detailed definition of a medicinal product, typically for uses other than direct patient care (e.g. regulatory use).</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductAuthorization\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductAuthorization\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductAuthorization</td>\n                <td>The regulatory authorization of a medicinal product.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductContraindication\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductContraindication\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductContraindication</td>\n                <td>The clinical particulars - indications, contraindications etc. of a medicinal product, including for regulatory purposes.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductIndication\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductIndication\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductIndication</td>\n                <td>Indication for the Medicinal Product.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductIngredient\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductIngredient\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductIngredient</td>\n                <td>An ingredient of a manufactured item or pharmaceutical product.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductInteraction\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductInteraction\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductInteraction</td>\n                <td>The interactions of the medicinal product with other medicinal products, or other forms of interactions.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductManufactured\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductManufactured\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductManufactured</td>\n                <td>The manufactured item as contained in the packaged medicinal product.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductPackaged\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductPackaged\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductPackaged</td>\n                <td>A medicinal product in a container or package.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductPharmaceutical\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductPharmaceutical\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductPharmaceutical</td>\n                <td>A pharmaceutical product described in terms of its composition and dose form.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MedicinalProductUndesirableEffect\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MedicinalProductUndesirableEffect\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MedicinalProductUndesirableEffect</td>\n                <td>Describe the undesirable effects of the medicinal product.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MessageDefinition\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MessageDefinition\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MessageDefinition</td>\n                <td>Defines the characteristics of a message that can be shared between systems, including the type of event that initiates the message, the content to be transmitted and what response(s), if any, are permitted.</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">MessageHeader\n                  <a name=\"resource-types-MessageHeader\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>MessageHeader</td>\n                <td>The header for a message exchange that is either requesting or responding to an action.
