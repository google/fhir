This element is used to reduce the quantity of data returned in searches. Note that servers may pre-cache summarized resources for optimal performance, so servers might not support per-profile use of the isSummary flag. When a request is made with _summary=true, serailisers only include elements marked as 'isSummary = true'. Other than Attachment.data, all data type properties are included in the summary form. In resource and data type definitions, if an element is at the root or has a parent that is 'mustSupport' and the minimum cardinality is 1 or the element is a modifier, it must be marked as isSummary=true.","requirements":"Allow clients to search through large resources quickly.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"ElementDefinition.isSummary","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"meaningWhenMissing":"An element is not included in the summary unless it is explicitly specified to be so","isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A (MIF territory)"},{"identity":"iso11179","map":"??"}]}]}}
