This qualifier may be used to explicitly indicate which given names are considered to be middle names. The middle name qualifier may also be used with family names. This is a Scandinavian use case, matching the concept of &quot;mellomnavn&quot;,&quot;mellannamn&quot;. Note that there are specific rules that indicate what names may be taken as a mellannamn in different Scandinavian countries. \t\t\t\t   \n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>PFX\n                  <a name=\"v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2-PFX\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>prefix</td>\n                <td>\n                        \n                           Description:A prefix has a strong association to the immediately following name part.
