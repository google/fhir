The log-normal distribution can be specified with the properties mean m and standard deviation s.  Note however that mean m and standard deviation s are the parameters of the raw value distribution, not the transformed parameters of the lognormal distribution that are conventionally referred to by the same letters.  Those log-normal parameters mlog and slog relate to the mean m and standard deviation s of the data value through slog2 = log (s2/m2 + 1) and mlog = log m - slog2/2.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>N\n                  <a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-N\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>normal (Gaussian)</td>\n                <td>\n                        This is the well-known bell-shaped normal distribution.  Because of the central limit theorem, the normal distribution is the distribution of choice for an unbounded random variable that is an outcome of a combination of many stochastic processes.  Even for values bounded on a single side (i.e. greater than 0) the normal distribution may be accurate enough if the mean is &quot;far away&quot; from the bound of the scale measured in terms of standard deviations.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>T\n                  <a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-T\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>T</td>\n                <td>\n                        Used to describe the quotient of a normal random variable and the square root of a c2 random variable.

Thus, the uniform distribution assigns the probability densities f(x) = sqrt(2 s sqrt(3))  to values m - s sqrt(3) &gt;= x &lt;= m + s sqrt(3) and f(x) = 0 otherwise.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>X2\n                  <a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-X2\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>chi square</td>\n                <td>\n                        Used to describe the sum of squares of random variables which occurs when a variance is estimated (rather than presumed) from the sample.
